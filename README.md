# Second review

## My notes

filtes applied to music<br/>
band pass filter is need - only alow freq to pass through within a certain range<br/>
array of integers as first argument<br/>
range should be specified as lower band and an upper band as an argument 40 - 1000 standard<br/>
method(Music, lowBand, UpperBand)<br/>
Possible we may get other than integers in array = Error<br/>

## Thoughts

Overall I am really happy with how it went, I ended up deleting a few tests to start with, but got there in the end.
